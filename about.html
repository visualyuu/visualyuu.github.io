            <h2>More about myself</h2>
            <p>
                In my free time, aside from code relevant to my interests, I like to play video games and make art.<br> I particularly like arcade rhythm games<br>
                My favorites tend to be the ones created by Konami. Although my favorite is Pop'n Music this does<br>
                include games like Dance Dance Revolution. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I had originally started school to become an animator but later on fell in love with the usefulness<br>
                of the skills learning to code gave me. I'm very interested in learning why the code I write works.
